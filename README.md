## Objective  

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust Expression Evaluation Tool in C++. This tool allows users to evaluate basic arithmetic expressions while handling operator precedence and parentheses. It demonstrates the practical implementation of data structures, algorithms, and error handling in C++ programming.

## Features and Functionalities  

* **Expression Parsing**:  
  * Accepts mathematical expressions as user input, supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
  * Parses and evaluates expressions while adhering to precedence rules and parenthetical scoping.  

* **Operator Precedence and Parentheses**:  
  * Implements precedence rules to ensure operations like multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.  
  * Accurately processes expressions containing nested or mismatched parentheses.  

* **Robust Error Handling**:  
  * Validates user input to handle invalid characters, mismatched parentheses, and division by zero.  
  * Provides clear and descriptive error messages for incorrect expressions or invalid operators.  

* **Stack-Based Algorithm**:  
  * Leverages stacks for efficient parsing and evaluation of expressions.  
  * Processes operators and operands using a single-pass, precedence-aware algorithm.

## Practical Applications  

* **Educational Tool**:  
  * Demonstrates stack usage in evaluating mathematical expressions, making it a useful resource for students and programmers learning C++.  
  * Highlights concepts like infix-to-postfix conversion, modular programming, and exception handling.  

* **Foundational Calculator**:  
  * Serves as a foundation for building advanced calculator applications, including scientific calculators with extended functionality.  

* **Validation Tool**:  
  * Can be extended to validate expressions, making it suitable for syntax-checking systems or input validators in larger applications.

## Benefits and Impact  

* **Learning Resource**:  
  * Provides a practical example of applying data structures (stacks) and algorithms to solve real-world programming problems.  
  * Encourages modular function design for enhanced readability and maintainability.  

* **Flexibility**:  
  * Supports extensions for advanced features like floating-point operations, additional mathematical functions, or custom operators.  

* **Error-Resistant**:  
  * Ensures reliability by identifying and handling common errors like invalid expressions or division by zero during evaluation.  

* **Efficient Execution**:  
  * Implements an O(n) algorithm to process expressions, ensuring fast and accurate results for complex inputs.
